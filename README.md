# Stud.IP Backend for rclone

This project provides an **rclone backend** for accessing files from **Stud.IP** instances.

Although it should work with all Stud.IP instances, it has currently only been tested with the [University of Bremen](https://elearning.uni-bremen.de) installation.

**Note:** This is a **proof of concept** and currently offers **limited functionality (read-only access)** and **may contain bugs**.
